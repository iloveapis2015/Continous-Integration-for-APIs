# Continous-Integration-for-APIs
With companies focusing on Go Live, most underestimate the importance of having a Continuos Delivery process. They have bits and pieces and fail to connect the dots to make it a complete automated process. With the advent of many new tools, it is lot easier to set up a CI process than one thinks. Among many advantages, a small investment early in the development life cycle will pay a huge benefit to grow the program at a faster pace and achieve a "faster time to market" delivery. In this session, we will get hands-on and setup a CI process using Cloud tools like Travis, Git and Apigee Cloud. We will discuss different tools available out there. You will walk out with an understanding, that setting up a CI delivery process is not "rocket science". You will be motivated to go back and connect the dots in your organization.
